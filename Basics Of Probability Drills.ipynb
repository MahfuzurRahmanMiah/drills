Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",
    "**There is a bias for getting self-reported answers from only a subset of the population, specifically those who happen to click on a link on the website. Thus, this group of users are not reflective of the total population of users surfing the company website. Furthermore, there is nothing mentioned as to whether a person who has already answered the survey will be asked to fill out the survey again. If he does, then there is an increase in repeat answers from some users, which also skews the results and the eventual average that is calculated.\n"
